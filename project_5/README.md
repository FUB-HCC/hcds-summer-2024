## Overview
The Stroke Prediction Web App offers healthcare professionals a tool to predict stroke risk based on patient data. It uses a logistic regression model trained on a dataset containing demographic information, health conditions, and lifestyle factors.

## Features
- **Input Patient Data:** Users can input patient details such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, etc.
- **Prediction Result:** The app provides real-time predictions on whether the patient is likely to experience a stroke.
- **Insightful Visualizations:** Includes interactive visualizations like histograms, correlation matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance plots.
- **Fairness Evaluation:** Evaluates model fairness using metrics like statistical parity and predictive parity across different demographic groups.
